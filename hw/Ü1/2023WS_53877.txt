Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - citing - source of information and knowledge (e.g., software, equations, data)
      - units - input and output numbers have units (e.g. N, kJ, m/s, Hz)
•  Writing and communication done well, which includes:
      - sentences - clean, concise and clear (C^3)
      - sentences - complete written when appropriate (e.g., within Markdown cells, docstrings, f-string)

Neutral:
•  Scholarship done okay, but with a few issues in the following:
      - citing - websites should include the date visited (e.g., Wikipedia)

Additional Notes: 
  - Citations still not up to standard, only the website links are available.
  - All variables are well documented with their respective units.


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas
      - markdown cells - good usage to communicate ideas, thoughts or workflow

Neutral:
•  Notebook could be slightly improved, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - some additional separation of ideas (both code and markdown cells)
      - markdown cells - some additional communication would have been more informative

Additional Notes: 
  - There is separation between different functions, but could be better. 
  - Could have typed in the variables' names directly instead of manually typing in the float values when calling the function.   


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - blank lines - consistent and good usage
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - naming - descriptive, human readable objects/variables naming
      - spacing - consistent and correct usage
      - writing - clean, concise and clearly (C^3) written code

Negative:
•  The following format issues were present in your code:
      - f-string - not used (e.g., print statements)

Additional Notes: 
  - Clean and concise naming, as well as indentations and lines.
  - No f-string used, but commas work fine too.
  - Good use of lines to separate parts of the assignment.


General Feedback:

Positive:
•  Overall, your work done on this assignment was:
      - good
