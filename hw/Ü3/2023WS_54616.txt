Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - citing - source of information and knowledge (e.g., software, equations, data)
      - units - input and output numbers have units (e.g. N, kJ, m/s, Hz)
•  Writing and communication done well, which includes:
      - sentences - clean, concise and clear (C^3)
      - sentences - complete written when appropriate (e.g., within Markdown cells, docstrings, f-string)

Negative:
•  Scholarship done poorly, which includes the following:
      - citing - missing reference numbers (e.g., [1, 2]) within your writing

Additional Notes: 
  Colleague already includes citing in the work, and peer - reviewed academic works were already utilized instead of only websites. However reference numbers are still missing (connecting knowledges / formulars / quotes used in the paper to their corresponding references) 


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas
      - markdown cells - good usage to communicate ideas, thoughts or workflow

Additional Notes: 
  Markdown cells used well for communicating ideas, but it would be better if the code cells were to be written under the big titles (for example: 
  
  Lennard Jones Equation:
  (some explainations...)
  (code cells here)


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - f-string - properly used
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - line length - properly done (i.e., not longer than 110 characters)
      - spacing - consistent and correct usage
      - writing - clean, concise and clearly (C^3) written code

Additional Notes: 
  Codes well written, with proper usage of comments. However some variables' names are rather uninformative (for example: variable "joules"). In spite of that comments are available so all in all nothing serious.


User-defined Functions:

Positive:
•  Good use of the following:
      - docstring - providing context; stating what the function does
      - docstring - defining input objects
      - docstring - defining returned object(s)
      - isolating ideas to user-defined functions

Additional Notes: 
  Ideas well divided into separate functions 


General Feedback:

Positive:
•  Overall, your work done on this assignment was:
      - excellent

Additional Notes: 
  The paper could be more aesthetically pleasant but who cares right ;))
